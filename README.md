XFB - Open Source Radio Automation Software by [Netpack Online Solutions](https://www.netpack.pt)

XFB is a software that can automate a radio station. 
It manages a database that allows you to catalogue and play music; jingles; publicities; programs; genres; and much more.


Currently XFB is only running under Gnu/Linux operating systems.

Despise the fact that XFB is already able to do a lot on it's own, there's still a lot to be written and improved.

If you like our software please consider supporting us, even if it's only with a very small amount. Thank you!
