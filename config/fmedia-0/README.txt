OVERVIEW
---------------
fmedia is a fast asynchronous media player/recorder/converter for Windows and Linux.  Its goal is to provide smooth playback even if input device is very slow and unresponsive.  The architecure allows to extend the functionality of the application in any way: adding a new audio input/output format, a new DSP filter or even a new GUI.  fmedia is very small and fast: it has low CPU & memory consumption making it ideal to listen to music or process audio files while running on a notebook's battery.

Note: it's beta version - not tested well enough, not all functions will work as expected.  See section "USE-CASES" to have an idea of which features should work.

---------------

---------------
INSTALL ON WINDOWS
---------------
1. Unpack archive to the directory of your choice, e.g. to "C:/Program Files/fmedia"

2. Optionally, add the path into the system environment:

	set PATH=%PATH%;C:/Program Files/fmedia

---------------
INSTALL ON LINUX
---------------
1. Unpack archive to the directory of your choice, e.g. to "/usr/local/fmedia-0":

	tar Jxf ./fmedia-0.8-linux-amd64.tar.xz -C /usr/local

2. Optionally, create a symbolic link:

	ln -s /usr/local/fmedia-0/fmedia /usr/local/bin/fmedia

---------------
BUILD ON LINUX
---------------
1. Create a directory for all needed sources:

	mkdir firmdev && cd firmdev

2. Download all needed source repositories:

	git clone https://github.com/stsaz/ffos
	git clone https://github.com/stsaz/ff
	wget http://firmdev.com/ff-3pt.tar.xz
	tar Jxf ff-3pt.tar.xz

	git clone https://github.com/stsaz/fmedia

3. Build

	cd fmedia
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:../ff-3pt/linux-amd64
	make install

4. Ready!  You can copy the directory ./fmedia-0 anywhere you want (see section "INSTALL ON LINUX").

---------------
CONFIG
---------------
The global configuration file "fmedia.conf" is located within the fmedia directory itself.  It contains all supported settings and their default values.  You must restart fmedia after you make changes to this file.

Per-user configuration settings are also supported, they must be stored in "fmedia.conf" file in home directory:
 Windows: %APPDATA%/fmedia/fmedia.conf
 Linux:   $HOME/.config/fmedia/fmedia.conf

Settings for a module must be in format "so.module.key value", e.g. to overwrite the global setting for OGG Vorbis encoding quality you should write:

	ogg-vorbis.encode.quality "7.0"

Core configuration settings start with "core.", e.g. set codepage for non-Unicode text:

	core.codepage win1252

---------------
EXTRACT TRACKS FROM flac.cue
---------------
If you're extracting a track from the album using CUE sheet, please note, that a track isn't exactly copied but first decoded to PCM and then re-encoded with FLAC.  Luckily, this behaviour won't result in any audio quality loss since FLAC is a lossless codec.  However, fmedia doesn't support pictures (album covers) in FLAC header, so they won't be copied into the output file.

---------------
TERMINAL UI
---------------
By default fmedia runs with a terminal UI, which shows information about the currently playing audio track and the currently playing audio position.  User commands such as seeking are also supported, all supported commands are described in file "help-tui.txt".

---------------
GRAPHICAL UI
---------------
If you specify '--gui' argument to fmedia binary, it will run in GUI mode:
	fmedia --gui

fmedia GUI is provided by a separate module - gui.dll.  It is written in such a way that it won't become unresponsive even if the main thread (the one that processes audio) is waiting for I/O operations.  The module doesn't perform any sound processing, it just issues commands to fmedia core and receives the feedback.

fmedia GUI is highly customizable, thanks to FF library that is used under the hood.  FF UI technology allows you to modify properties of every UI control: windows, buttons, menus, tray icons and more.  You may resize controls, set different styling, change any text, hotkeys, etc.  All this information is stored within "fmedia.gui" which is a plain text file.  After you make some changes in fmedia.gui, save it and then restart fmedia.
